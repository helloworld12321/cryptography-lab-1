(Monday, August 31. This is Joe speaking.)

I have a suspicion that someone will use Rick Astley's "Never Gonna Give You
Up" as their plaintext, so just for fun, I'm going to do a first pass over all
of the cipher texts to check them against the verse and the chorus. ðŸ™ƒ

To help with this, I've written a quick script named
`plaintext_checker.py`, which can be invoked like so:

```sh
jython ./plaintext_checker.py -p 'plaintext fragment' ciphertext1.txt ciphertext2.txt ciphertext3.txt
```

This script takes the guessed plaintext fragment, subtracts it from each
ciphertext in turn (using the decrypt() function), and prints out the result.
If we guessed the plaintext correctly, we would expect the result to look
something like this:

```
keykeykeykeykeykeykeykeykeykejlkmfsvuoijknqwdaoipklmwfpojklmwefcpok...
```

...And sure enough, Cassie and Jake's plaintext is

```

```

with the key `rolled`. ðŸ™ƒ

I also checked against the first sentences of the Declaration of Independence
and Pride and Prejudice, but that didn't come up with anything.

However, the Star Wars opening crawl worked!

Brian and Aaron's ciphertext is

Okay, so, I'm looking at Prof. Elena's ciphertext, and it looks like the
sequence "ji" occurs a bunch of times. 

In particular, between the first two occurrences, we can probably count how
many characters apart they are! 

(23 characters) 

Now, that's not good, since there's no way that the key is 23 letters long, and
since 23 is prime, there's no way that the key could have been repeated. 

So, we probably have to conclude that those two occurrences of "ji" encode
different things. 

The sequence "qj" appears a lot (including at the beginning of the text) 
The distance between the first two occurrences of "qj" is

```jython
len("japkofclpgauficevhvujgebkgtdjhzctdssphzrvgnrbvvoccgueecjvolblkezgljejhmfyftspacmrknxwfhoiasvifbkaskseuiecjfeihgutlrqvhvvafdvbsupvqluowhzgspglgmj")
```

(144 characters) 

Which means that the key could be 2, 3, 4, 6, or 8 characters long. 
 
Which is better than nothing, I guess :) 

The distance between the second two occurrences of "qj" is 

```jython
len("qjapkofclpgauijikgdkctterqzerpdlqgiohjitgweuiwlaspglgmjoffgrwfcctskutfhzgcfblgnkgghee")
```

(85 characters) 

which means the key could be either 5 or 17 characters long.

Uffda.
